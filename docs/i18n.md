# Internationalization 

> MO files: MO, or Machine Object is a binary data file that contains object data referenced by a program. It is typically used to translate program code, and may be loaded or imported into the GNU gettext program.

> PO files: PO files are the files which contain the actual translations. Each language will have its own PO file, for example, for French there would be a fr.po file, for german there would be a de.po, for American English there might be en-US.po.

> POT file: POT files are the template files for PO files. They will have all the translation strings left empty. A POT file is essentially an empty PO file without the translations, with just the original strings.


### Create POT files 

```sh
wp language core install af --activate
```

```sh
wp i18n make-pot wp-content/plugins/vegashero/ wp-content/plugins/vegashero/languages/vegashero.pot
```

### [Update existing POT files](http://punt.sourceforge.net/gettext/gettext_6.html)

```sh
msgmerge --update vegashero-af.po vegashero.pot 
```

### Create MO files

```sh
msgfmt -o vegashero-af.mo vegashero-af.po
```
